			<h2 class = "centered full-underline">The Value of Fantasy</h2>
			<p>Many people look down on the literary genre of fantasy as a whole. It is irrelevant and escapist. As such, it wastes time. However, good fantasy exists, and it is none of these things, but rather something which has caused me and many others to grow in our appreciation of the world, and given an inspiration to act as good people within it. </p>
			<p>Fantasy in literature takes us away from the familiar day to day world, and drops us in entirely new places. It may be a world like ours, but with magical beings, and fantastic societies. Or, it could take us into a version of our world only differing in its location in time and space. But however it is situated, well-written fantasy awakens us to the wonder within this world. After reading about the body of Boromir being carried over Rauros Falls in a skiff, surrounded by the weapons of his foes, we may pay more attention to the beauty of a physical waterfall, as we imagine a boat rushing underneath the observation bridge, over the rocky edge, and into the foaming pool below. A skillfully written tale about talking animals or trees causes us to appreciate afresh the complexity and beauty of the flora and fauna around us.</p> 
			<p>In addition, fantasy can cause us to be better people in the real world. As we read of valiant heroes or brave explorers or admirable leaders, we become inspired to imitate them. By the same token, evil, corrupted, or apathetic characters can cause us to see our own flaws. No one wants to be like Eustace, always flaunting their own knowledge, or like Benjamin the donkey in Animal Farm, capable of raising resistance to an evil, but choosing not to.</p>
			<p>Fantasy is an indispensible genre of literature. It moves us to live as protagonists in our own stories. It renews our delight in the world around us. As G.K. Chesterton states in chapter IV of Orthodoxy regarding fairy tales, “These tales say that apples were golden only to refresh the forgotten moment when we found they were green.“</p>
